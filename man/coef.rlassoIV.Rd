\title{Coefficients from S3 objects \code{rlassoIV}}
\usage{
\method{coef}{rlassoIV}(object, complete = TRUE, selection.matrix = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class \code{rlassoIV}, usually a result of a call \code{rlassoIV} with options \code{select.X=TRUE} and \code{select.Z=TRUE}.}

\item{complete}{general option of the function \code{coef}.}

\item{selection.matrix}{if TRUE, a selection matrix is returned that indicates the selected variables from each first stage regression.
Default is set to FALSE. See section on details for more information.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to function coef.}
}
\value{
Coefficients obtained from \code{rlassoIV} by default. If option \code{selection.matrix} is \code{TRUE}, a list is returned with final coefficients, a matrix \code{selection.matrix}, and a matrix \code{selection.matrixZ}:
\code{selection.matrix} contains the selection index for the lasso regression of \code{y} on \code{x} (first column) and the lasso regression of the predicted values of \code{d} on \code{x}
together with the union of these indizes.
\code{selection.matrixZ} contains the selection index from the first-stage lasso regression of \code{d} on \code{z} and \code{x}.
}
\description{
Method to extract coefficients from objects of class \code{rlassoIV}.
}
\details{
Printing coefficients and selection matrix for S3 object \code{rlassoIV}. \code{"x"} indicates that a variable has been selected, i.e., the corresponding estimated coefficient is different from zero.
The very last column collects all variables that have been selected in at least one of the lasso regressions represented in the \code{selection.matrix}.
\code{rlassoIV} performs three lasso regression steps. A first stage lasso regression of the endogenous treatment variable \code{d} on the instruments \code{z} and exogenous covariates \code{x},
a lasso regression of \code{y} on the exogenous variables \code{x}, and a lasso regression of the instrumented treatment variable, i.e., a regression of the predicted values of \code{d}, on controls \code{x}.

\examples{
\dontrun{
data(EminentDomain)
z <- EminentDomain$logGDP$z # instruments
x <- EminentDomain$logGDP$x # exogenous variables
y <- EminentDomain$logGDP$y # outcome varialbe
d <- EminentDomain$logGDP$d # treatment / endogenous variable
lasso.IV <- rlassoIV(x = x, d = d, y = y, z = z, select.X = TRUE, select.Z = TRUE)
coef(lasso.IV) # default behavior
coef(lasso.IV, selection.matrix = T) # print selection matrix
