\usage{
\method{coef}{rlassoEffects}(
  object,
  complete = TRUE,
  selection.matrix = FALSE,
  include.targets = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class \code{rlassoEffects}, usually a result of a call \code{rlassoEffect} or \code{rlassoEffects}.}

\item{complete}{general option of the function \code{coef}.}

\item{selection.matrix}{if TRUE, a selection matrix is returned that indicates the selected variables from each auxiliary regression.
Default is set to FALSE.}

\item{include.targets}{if FALSE (by default) only the selected control variables are listed in the \code{selection.matrix}. If set to TRUE,
the selection matrix will also indicate the selection of the target coefficients that are specified in the  \code{rlassoEffects} call.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to functions coef or print.}
}
\description{
Method to extract coefficients from objects of class \code{rlassoEffects}
}
\details{
Printing coefficients and selection matrix for S3 object \code{rlassoEffects}. Interpretation of entries in the selection matrix
\itemize{
 \item \code{"-"} indicates a target variable,
 \item \code{"x"} indicates that a variable has been selected with rlassoEffects (coefficient is different from zero),
 \item \code{"."} indicates that a variable has been de-selected with rlassoEffects (coefficient is zero).

library(hdm)
set.seed(1)
n <- 100 # sample size

  method = "double selection"
)
coef(lasso.effect) # standard use of coef() - without selection matrix
# with selection matrix
coef(lasso.effect, selection.matrix = TRUE)
# prettier output with print_coef (identical options as coef())
