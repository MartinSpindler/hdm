\title{hdm: High-Dimensional Metrics}
\description{
This package implements methods for estimation and inference in a high-dimensional setting.
}
\details{
\tabular{ll}{ Package: \tab hdm\cr Type: \tab Package\cr Version: \tab
0.1\cr Date: \tab 2015-05-25\cr License: \tab GPL-3\cr } This package provides efficient estimators
and  uniformly valid confidence intervals for various low-dimensional causal/structural parameters
appearing in high-dimensional approximately sparse models. The package
includes functions for fitting heteroskedastic robust Lasso regressions with non-Gaussian erros and
for instrumental variable (IV) and treatment effect estimation in a
high-dimensional setting. Moreover, the methods enable valid post-selection
inference. Moreover, a theoretically grounded, data-driven choice of the penalty level is provided.
