# hdm: High-Dimensional Metrics
![build](https://github.com/MartinSpindler/hdm/workflows/build/badge.svg) [![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/hdm)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=hdm) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/MartinSpindler/hdm/master.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/MartinSpindler/hdm?branch=master)

Implementation of selected high-dimensional statistical and econometric methods for estimation and inference. Efficient estimators and uniformly valid confidence intervals for various low-dimensional causal/ structural parameters are provided which appear in high-dimensional approximately sparse models. Including functions for fitting heteroscedastic robust Lasso regressions with non-Gaussian errors and for instrumental variable (IV) and treatment effect estimation in a high-dimensional setting. Moreover, the methods enable valid post-selection inference and rely on a theoretically grounded, data-driven choice of the penalty. 


## Getting Started with `hdm`

R is an open source software project and can be freely downloaded from the CRAN website along with its associated documentation. There are two options to install the `R` package `hdm` - either installation of the development version or the stable release available at [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hdm). 

### Development Version

The current development version of the `hdm` package is maintained in this repository and can be installed by the command `devtools::install_github("MartinSpindler/hdm")`. Note that the `devtools` package is required for this command.

### Stable Release

The stable package release is available at [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=hdm). The stable release version can be installed by typing `install.packages("hdm")` in `R`.

### Getting Started: Vignette

After installation, users can get started by following [the package vignette](doc/hdm.pdf).
